I am pleased to announce that I have successfully completed Task 3 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Infotech. 
This task involved building a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior using the bank marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
This project allowed me to dive deep into predictive modeling, enhancing my ability to interpret complex data and make informed decisions. The experience has been invaluable in strengthening my technical skills and understanding of machine learning algorithms.
